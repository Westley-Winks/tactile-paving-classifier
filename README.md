# Tactile Paving Mapper: Project Overview
---
- Fine tuned DETR object detection model to detect tactile paving in images
- I messaged the authors of [this](https://doras.dcu.ie/26261/) paper from the Crowd4Access project and they were kind enough to send me 2,119 annotated images. Huge shout out to them!

## Problem
---
This project had many inspirations: [this](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/curb-cuts/) 99 Percent Invisible podcast, [this](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/garbage-route-optimization-using-computer-vision-object-detection-17a217d5582d) trash mapping article, and [this](https://doras.dcu.ie/26261/) research paper.

People with vision problems need resources in the built world to help them navigate it. One of these resources are known as tactile paving: the usually yellow mats of raised bumps found at intersections. When someone using a cane feels this tactile paving, they know that they are at an intersection and should proceed with caution before walking across the intersection.

Cities should be built around the people that live there. But how do we know if our cities are, in fact, accessible and inclusive? What if we could push images of our cities through a machine learning model and produce a heatmap of where infrastructure building should be prioritized?

That is the goal of this project. A machine learning model with be trained to detect tactile paving in an image. EXIF data will be pulled from the images to get a approximate location for generating a heat map. This can be used by city government and citizens alike to get a better understanding of the accessibility landscape of their built environment, wherever that may be.

## Tools
---
**Packages:** pytorch, transformers, tensorboard, tensorflow, keras

**Environment:** conda, Jupyter, VSCode

## Data
---
- All the data is from the kind folks at the [Crowd4Access Project!](https://crowd4access.insight-centre.org/)
- Data was crowd sourced by citizens in Ireland generating photos of streets and footpaths
- Over 2,000 of these images were annotated by hand to create a bounding box around the tactile paving in those images

## Model
---
- Fine tuned DETR model with ResNet backbone from Hugging Face
- In progress: Building custom model inspired by YOLO (without dividing the image)

## Future Work
---
- Try other models (YOLO, R-CNN etc.)
- Try DETR with a different convolutional backbone
- Once sufficiently accurate: Map Bend, OR!
